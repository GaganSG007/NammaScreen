# 🎬 NammaScreen

> A mobile application built using Java and Android Studio to help small, local theatres bring their showtimes and bookings online.  
> Developed as a 6th-semester academic project, this app was designed with practicality, purpose, and just the right amount of chaos an engineering student brings to the table.

## 📌 About

**NammaScreen** was created with a clear mission – to bridge the gap between traditional local theatres and the world of online movie booking.

In many smaller towns, old and independently run theatres still rely on offline ticketing. With **NammaScreen**, the idea was to offer them an affordable digital solution for:

- Online ticket booking  
- Seat selection  
- Private screenings  
- Email-based booking receipts  
- And Firebase-powered login via Gmail

Some of these features were fully implemented, while others remained exciting concepts due to the constraints of a semester-long project – but the foundation was solid.
